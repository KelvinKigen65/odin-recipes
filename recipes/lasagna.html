   <h1>How to prepare Pork stew</h1>
   <p>I was shocked at how authentic this pork stew in green salsa (guisado de puerco con tomatillos) recipe was to his mom's and grandmother's recipe. This is a delicious, not too spicy, authentic Mexican pork stew that is easy to make and a recipe that everyone in your family will enjoy. Serve with Spanish rice and warm tortillas.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Onions</li>
    <li>Cooking oil</li>
    <li>Pork</li>
   </ul>
   <ol>
    <li>Combine flour, pepper, 1 teaspoon salt, and cumin in a large bowl. Dredge pork in flour mixture until well coated.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large, heavy pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmers. Add pork, in batches, in a single layer; brown on all sides, about 15 minutes. Transfer pork to a bowl; cover to keep warm.

    </li>
    <li>Add onion to pan; cook and stir over medium heat, adding more olive oil if necessary, until translucent and beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Return pork to pan; stir in tomatillos, water, canned chiles, 1/2 cup cilantro, jalape√±os, garlic, and marjoram. Check seasoning; add 1 pinch salt, if needed. Cover and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until pork tender, about 1 hour. Degrease stew before serving in bowls, garnished with sour cream and cilantro.</li>
